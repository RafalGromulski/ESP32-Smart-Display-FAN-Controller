# ESP32-Smart-Display-FAN-Controller
Project made to learn electronics and ESP32 programming. A self-contained device with OLED display and all parts in an enclosure. The screen shows temperature, humidity and pressure from Home Assistant via MQTT. DS18B20 measures internal temp; a fan is driven by ESP32 with N-MOSFET and hysteresis to prevent overheating.
